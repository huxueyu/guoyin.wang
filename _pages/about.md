I am currently leading Qwen Pilot, a newly established group within the [Qwen](https://chat.qwen.ai/) family. Our mission is to tackle the long-term, intricate challenges in the evolution of large language models. The team is dedicated to both deepening the understanding of large-scale language models and developing practical, versatile Qwen models that excel across a wide range of scenarios. Before joining Qwen, I led the post-training team at 01.AI, which built the Yi-series models.
