I am currently leading **Qwen Pilot**, a newly established group within the [Qwen](https://chat.qwen.ai/) family at [Alibaba](https://www.alibabagroup.com/). Our mission is to tackle the long-term, intricate challenges in the evolution of large language models. The team is dedicated to both deepening the understanding of large-scale language models and developing practical, versatile Qwen models that excel across a wide range of scenarios. Before joining Qwen, I led the post-training team at [01.AI](https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/), which built the [Yi](https://huggingface.co/01-ai)-series models.
